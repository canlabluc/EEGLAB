- Functionify scripts
- Change corresponding GUI calls to reflect functions. See e.g. SIFT for how to do callbacks
- Add simple GUIs to functions, e.g. like EEGLAB
- Have functions create directories that user specifies, if they do not already exist
- Fit ~10th order polynomials onto power spectrum when a bad TF/IAF is detected. Would choosing the local minima for TF/local maxima for IAF here allow us to automate without having to intervene?
