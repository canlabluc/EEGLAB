On analytic flexibility and pre-registration
============================================

How it impacts my field:
- In systems neuro, there's just such a huge amount of data that you're bound to
find things that correlate. For example, say we record from 1,000 neurons
simultaneously and find that 165 of them are incredibly "selective" for a
decision. Is this 165 number surprising? Or not surprising? Did we expect them
to be selective in the specific ways in which they were?

- Unclear to me when something is postdiction and when something is prediction,
still. Is the difference simply that the experiment and analysis was
specifically specified ahead of time, for that finding?

Problem not just with having analytic flexibility -- specifically, with having
it while looking at data
- Stopping criteria -- when to stop data collection
- Exclusion -- what data is excluded?
- Analysis choices -- which covariates, raw, normalized?
- Which is the 'key' DV?

Hard thing: counting the things that you decided not to consider, from looking
at the data -- what things did you deem "uninteresting"?

Are you still falling into the issue at hand here, even after performing
multiple comparisons correction? Probably. Really the issue is that we shouldn't
confuse prediction and postdiction.


What's the issue with not ~utilizing all~ of our variables?
- Well, it depends on what you want to do. If your goal is just estimating the
effect for all of these variables, maybe all of them are small.

Soln to the problem:
	1. Exploratory work -- e.g. gain expertise
	2. Specify model, relationship between variables. Fully operationalized,
	quantified. Could be a full-blown computational model, w/e. We want to form a
	hypothesis.
	3. Test prediction -- make an experiment, collect the data, test 2.

Important to emphasize that pre-registration does not address psychopathic
behavior -- aims at scientists that are perhaps unknowingly perpetuating bad
practices.

Pre-registartion is in one way trying to get back to the days of considering
ideas simply by themselves -- apart from the data.

Also, pre-reg is good for null results! Ameliorates people going on and on with
finding a new idea that's already been thought of but failed.

Pre-reg template for psych studies: van 't Veer A.E., Giner-Sorolla, 2016

-- One issue with pre-reg: people are going to look at my pre-regs and do the
same experiment!

Issue: cogneuro and sysneuro doesn't have a prereg template

In another way pre-registration is about shedding light on the process of
science prior to the paper and publishing. How decisions were made prior to all
of this.

How do you generate preprocessing streams which do not relate to your hypothesis
in any way? Is this possible?

Important to do internal replications -- separate the pilot data from the actual
experiment! On separate subjects, separate exp, w/e.

One thing I'd like to see more in sysneuro is some kind of prediction about the
number of neurons you'd perhaps see that respond, and also in what specific way
to specific stimuli.
	- Quite obvious that you get action-related signal throughout e.g. the entire
	brain, so how useful is it to say "there are decision-making neurons here"?

	- Quite problematic that people don't preregister with sysneuro -- you end up
	going into a certain region and you're probably bound to find neurons that
	respond in some way to whatever stimulus you're showing.
Issue of letting your data guide your hypothesis testing is problematic because
of this.
